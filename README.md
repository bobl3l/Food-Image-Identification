# Food Image Identification - Machine Learning Project

This is a personal project to build a **machine learning model** that identifies food items from images. The goal is to explore image classification techniques using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The project involves preprocessing image data, building a convolutional neural network (CNN), and evaluating the model's performance.

---

## Project Overview

The project focuses on classifying food images into different categories using a deep learning model. It includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting food images.
- **Model Building**: Creating a CNN using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on a dataset and evaluating its accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Prepares image data for training.
- **CNN Model**: A convolutional neural network for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy and loss to assess model performance.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The script loads and preprocesses food images using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`.
   - Images are resized, normalized, and split into training and validation sets.

2. **Model Building**:
   - A CNN model is built using Keras with layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, and `Dense`.
   - Example:
     ```python
     model = Sequential([
         Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
         MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
         Flatten(),
         Dense(128, activation='relu'),
         Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
     ])
     ```

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - The model is trained using the preprocessed image data.
   - Training progress is monitored using accuracy and loss metrics.
   - Example:
     ```python
     history = model.fit(
         train_generator,
         epochs=10,
         validation_data=validation_generator
     )
     ```

## Usage

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bobl3l/Food-Image-Identification.git
   cd Food-Image-Identification
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Food image Identification - ML project.ipynb"
   ```

4. **Customize the Model**:
   - Modify the CNN architecture or hyperparameters in the notebook to experiment with different configurations.

## Data

The project uses a dataset of food images. You can replace the dataset with your own by updating the paths in the notebook. Ensure the dataset is organized into folders, with each folder representing a food category.

Example dataset structure:
```
dataset/
    pizza/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
    burger/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
    ...
```

---

## Model Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Loss**: The difference between predicted and actual labels.

Example evaluation:
```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(validation_generator)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

---

## Visualizations

The project includes visualizations of:
1. **Training Progress**: Accuracy and loss curves over epochs.
2. **Sample Predictions**: Examples of model predictions on test images.

Example visualization code:
```python
plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Notes

- **Dataset Size**: A larger dataset may improve model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs.
- **Overfitting**: Use techniques like dropout or data augmentation to prevent overfitting.
